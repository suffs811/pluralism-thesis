# Pluralism Thesis
Python script for analyzing moral values via NLP/LDA for topic modeling and generating a frequency distribution 

I wrote this script for my gradue thesis. The script:
1. Identifies the top ten LDA topics for the Moral Values list
2. Classifies the top ten LDA topics according to the Moral Values list
3. Produces a frequency distribution for the top ten most used Moral Values
