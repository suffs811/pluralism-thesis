# Analysis of Moral Values Using Natural Language Processing
Python script for analyzing moral values via Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) & the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for topic modeling. 

I wrote this script for my gradue thesis. The script:
1. identifies the ten most salient topics of the Moral Values list
2. classifies the topics according a single value from the Moral Values list
3. produces a frequency distribution for the ten most used values in the Moral Values list
